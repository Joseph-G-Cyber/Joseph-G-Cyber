Computer Programming lecture 1 25/09/25:

A program is:
a set of instructions
To express how to solve a problem or perform a task
Written in a specialised language
That can be executed by a computer
And read and understood by other programmers

Sequence:
Steps are carried out in order, one at a time

Selection:
Some steps are included, or omitted, depending on some condition

Iteration:
Some steps are repeated, until something happens

Instructions are read much more than they are written. So are programs. Programs (code) are read much more often than they are written. The ration is something like 10:1. Code is read for validation, or for maintenance.

We can understand programs because:
There are words that we recognise
Various names of things have been chosen to help a reader
We can take reasonable guesses

To be a programmer you need to be able to find problems, understand the causes and fix them. Break down large programs / Ideas into smaller ideas.

Programmers are good at programming because they have experience. They have seen all the problems before and they know how to solve them.

Experience is the key to programming. It is the key to all skills. Gain it by practice and making mistakes.
